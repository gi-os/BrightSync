/**
 * Point the wheel at a scroller. Six-ish notches to a screenful on the LPIII panel.
 *
 * Two things make this feel like scrolling rather than like a slide projector:
 *
 *  - **A debt paid off per frame.** The sensor fires a notch every ~35 ms, faster than a
 *    frame, so applying each on arrival stacks up instant jumps with nothing to follow. Here
 *    each notch adds distance owed and every frame pays [SMOOTHING] of it, so one notch
 *    glides and a fast spin becomes one continuous sweep that coasts a little past your thumb.
 *  - **A bump guard.** The wheel sits under a thumb. The first notch after a pause is held
 *    back and only released when a second one confirms it was deliberate.
 *
 * Positive notches move *down* the page — the wheel drags the content the way a thumb does.
